# CALDERA plugin: GUI

The GUI plugin adds a basic web application structure to core CALDERA. This structure
includes components like login/logout, an authentication service and a home page
which will display all other plugins.

If you have loaded this plugin, CALDERA will now be accessible at https://localhost:8888,
as well as the terminal.
